# SWE-TASK-SERVICE

This is a simple task service that allows users to create, read, update and delete tasks. The service is built using the
Java Spring Boot framework and gRPC for communication between the client and the server, PostgreSQL for the database,
and Docker for containerization, and Github Actions for CI/CD.
